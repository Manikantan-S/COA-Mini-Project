NO_OF_VEH: The number of vehicles in the simulation.
bg: Background image or surface.
veh: Vehicle image or surface.
NODE_SIGNALS= EVERY CROSSROAD THAT IS 3 OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED FOR EASE

Lists (rand_x, rand_y, rand_road_no, rand_dir) containing random positions, road numbers, and directions for spawning vehicles.
The out_roads list contains road numbers that are considered outside the bounds of the simulation.
Various other constants used for signaling and vehicle behavior.
Functions:

The code defines several functions that will be used to manage traffic signals and vehicle movement.
signal_density_manager Class:

This class defines an object to manage the density of vehicles near a signal.
It has methods for calculating and managing the density of vehicles.
It's used to adjust signal states and timings based on vehicle density.
init_sig_info and add_extra_time Functions:

init_sig_info initializes signal data.
add_extra_time adds extra time to the green phase of a signal.
manage_signal_system Function:

This function iterates through the signal density manager objects and manages their signal states based on vehicle density.
motion Function:

The core of the code is the motion function.It is mentioned as def motion(c). It handles vehicle movement and interactions with signals.
It first checks the position and direction of each vehicle and its distance from nearby signals.
Vehicles outside the bounds are repositioned randomly.
Vehicles that are not in range of signals continue their current direction.
Vehicles in the range of active signals may change their direction.
There is logic to determine vehicle turns and repositioning at intersections.
get_random_direction Function:

This function returns a random direction for a vehicle when it reaches an intersection based on its current direction and available paths.
Main Loop:

The main loop of the code runs a simulation, where vehicles are moved, signals are managed, and the Pygame visualization is updated.
It checks for user input to quit the simulation.

VIVA QUESTIONS
q1) Now if we want to change add_extra time(5,0,0) to add_extra time(6,1,3) what will happen ?
Ans) In the provided code, changing the values of add_extra_time(6, 1, 3) would impact the behavior of the code, specifically regarding signal timing and traffic density management. Here's how the changes would affect the code:

add_extra_time(6, 1, 3) increases the time duration for Signal 1 (S0) and Lane 3 (N3) by 6 time units. Here's how it would affect the code execution:

Signal 1 (S0) would stay active for an additional 6 time units.
For Lane 3 (N3) of Signal 1, the signal's duration would also be extended by 6 time units.
The graph that displays signal density would be updated accordingly, showing the effect of the additional time for Signal 1, Lane 3.
The rest of the code, including vehicle movement and signal management, would continue to operate based on the updated signal timings.
Overall, the change in extra time allocation would affect the timing and coordination of signals, potentially leading to changes in traffic flow and congestion at specific intersections.

Q2)What will happen when present_c value is changed?
Ans) We will have to modify the conditions the array directions and a lot of things for the program to function properly as each  

Q3) If we observe we see that there is road_lanes_dimensions?Now what do all they represent and how are they represented ?
Ans) It reresents basically lane width and lane limits.They are represneted in the form of a tuple .
If we change any values  in that we will see the difference in the width
If we change the first value in that there error will occur as we have to change at many places below as rand_range,rand_position values will be effected
Q4) What happens here after  this vehicles_in_each_lane = []?
So basically the signal is trying to initialize vehicles here using the values mentioned in the for loop .Now if this fails the thing that will happen is that 
it will rturn a senitel value as (-1,1) ok .The reasons why the vehicle position allocation may fail is because Overcrowded Lane,Lane Width,Random Chance and Collision with Existing Vehicles

Q5)What does the function change_position do ?
Ans) It calculates the number of times the vehicle has changed its position and also the while loop check whether that each vehicle on the road has been indexed by i 

Q6)CRUX OF THE CODE =>motion function
ANS6) This is the explanation for def motion(c)

Loop Over Vehicles:

for i in range(NO_OF_VEH):
This loop iterates over each vehicle in the simulation, where NO_OF_VEH represents the total number of vehicles.

Get Signal Information:

k, signal_status, node_id = get_signal_info(vehicles[i].position_x, vehicles[i].position_y, vehicles[i].direction, vehicles[i].road_no)
It calls a function get_signal_info to determine information related to the traffic signal, including k (which might be a signal state), signal_status (whether the signal is active or not), and node_id.

Density Precondition Checking:

a, b, c = get_info_from_veh(vehicles[i].position_x, vehicles[i].position_y, vehicles[i].direction, vehicles[i].road_no)
Another function, get_info_from_veh, is used to get information about the vehicle's position, direction, and road. The results are stored in a, b, and c.

After this, the code calculates mod_x and mod_y based on the vehicle's position and a reference point. It seems to be checking if the vehicle is within a certain distance from this reference point. If it is, it calls append_density to track the vehicle's presence.

Random Coordinates and Properties:

rand_x = [125, 705, 995, 1370, 1370, 0,  0, 100, 513, 1085]
rand_y = [770, 770, 770, 300, 680, 220, 510, 0, 0, 0]
rand_road_no = [17, 13, 8, 5, 18, 0, 14, 9, 10, 6]
rand_dir = ["North", "North", "North", "West", "West", "East", "East", "South", "South", "South"]
ch_r = random.randint(0, 9)
Here, four lists are defined, each containing random values. ch_r is set to a random integer between 0 and 9. These lists are used for resetting the position and properties of vehicles that go out of bounds or require a change in direction.

Out of Bounds Checking:

out_roads = [0, 9, 14, 17, 13, 8, 18, 5, 6, 10]
if vehicles[i].road_no in out_roads:
This section checks if a vehicle has gone out of bounds (e.g., the road ends). If so, it resets the vehicle's position to random values based on rand_x and rand_y and updates the road and direction. The change is made if the vehicle is out of bounds in a specific direction (e.g., "East" or "West").

Motion Based on Signal Status:
if k == 0:
    # Vehicle is not in range of the signal
    # Adjust the position of the vehicle based on its direction
elif signal_status == 0 and k != 0:
    # The signal is active, and the vehicle is in the range of the signal
    # Continue with the existing direction
elif signal_status == 1 and k != 0:
    # The signal is not active, and the vehicle is in the range of the signal
    # Get a random direction, remove density, and manage signal system
Turning Paradigms:
A set of conditions determine how the vehicle's road, position, and direction change based on its current direction and a randomly generated direction1. The logic appears to simulate vehicle movements and road choices based on the current road network's structure.

The overall purpose of this code is to simulate vehicle motion within a road network, taking into account traffic signals, density monitoring, and out-of-bounds scenarios. It models how vehicles move and change direction within the simulated environment based on various conditions and rules.

In the motion function if we see any rand_x or rand_y values we see we have around 10 values why so ?
This is because In this code, ch_r is assigned a random integer between 0 and 9, which will be used to select one of the 10 elements from these lists. The purpose of these lists is to provide random coordinates, road numbers, and directions for repositioning vehicles that go out of bounds or need to be relocated. Having 10 elements allows for a variety of options for repositioning vehicles.


Q7)DENSITY CALCULATION EXPLAINED IN DETAIL IN def motion(c)

Ans 7) get_info_from_veh: This function is used to obtain information about the vehicle's current location and its road. The function returns three values: a, b, and c.

l1 and l2 are assigned the x and y coordinates, respectively, of a signal that the vehicle is approaching. These coordinates are extracted from a nested data structure, signals[a][b][2][0] and signals[a][b][2][1]. The structure signals[a][b] contains information related to the signal at position a, b, and [2] specifies that we want the coordinates of the signal.

The code then calculates mod_x and mod_y, which represent the differences between the vehicle's current position and the signal's x and y coordinates, respectively. These differences (mod_x and mod_y) are always positive or zero due to the absolute difference calculation.

The code checks whether mod_x or mod_y (whichever is smaller) is less than a threshold value ref minus 50. If either of them is less than ref - 50, it indicates that the vehicle is within a certain proximity of the signal, and as a result, the density of vehicles in that area should be appended.

If the condition for appending density is met, the function append_density(i, a, b) is called. It is assumed that this function appends the current vehicle's information (possibly the index i, and the signal coordinates a and b) to a list that tracks the density of vehicles in that area.
